# GO CRUD

GO CRUD is a Restfull API project that uses the Go programming language or often called the Go Language.

To create a CRUD Project I use the API. With methods:

- GET ==> To get all records.
- POST ==> To create a record.
- PUT ==> To update a record with passing the ID.
  DELETE ==> To delete a record with passing THE ID.

### All available PATH URLs.

```
GET    | /api/v1/data
POST   | /api/v1/data/post
PUT    | /api/v1/data/put?id={ID DATA}
DELETE | /api/v1/data/delete?id={ID DATA}
```

> To use my project it would be nice if you use a software called [Postman](http://www.postman.com).
